# c9.ide.desktop
Adds a desktop GUI to cloud9's ide using x11.

**Please Note: That this plugin only works on ubuntu systems if using the c9sdk and the official c9.io platform**

## Installation Bug with Cloud9's Plugin System... (npmlog)

This looks to be fixed.

# Update 11/28/2016

I'll be working on updating this plugin soon in the published repo on c9's system. Once done, the cli install should work correctly again. C9 has had issues with publishing and installing plugins. It looks like this may be fixed so I'll get this all packaged up and sent over.

No ETA on this, but it is officially on my list of todo's!

## What is this used for
Any programs that need a gui interface to write out to, such as Python's turtle package, can use this approach to develop and test in cloud9.


## Commands

Open Desktop in new Tab:
MAC: `COMMAND-SHIFT-ALT-D`
WIN: `CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-D`

## Installation

use command `c9 install c9.ide.desktop` and then reload your editor.

In order to use custom plugins during alpha you need to change some settings in your c9 workspace.

Go to `Cloud9>Preferences>Experimental>SDK` and enable the two toggles for `Load Plugins From Workspace` and `Load Custom Plugins`. That should do the trick!

**Please Note: That this will install needed packages automatically. Any issues please file an issue here at github**

Does it not work when you clikc 'start desktop'? Make sure you have added websocketfy

```
$> sudo apt-get install websockify
```

## Usage

There are two commands that are built into the editor. These are accessible under the view menu at the top of the ide.
